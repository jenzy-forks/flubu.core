    ```

    ```c#
    [GitVersion]
    public GitVersion BuildVersion { get;  }
    ```

    This allows  access version information in ConfigureTarget which was not possible if versioning task was executed for example as         target dependency
    ```c#
    protected override void ConfigureTargets(ITaskContext context)
    {
            context.CreateTarget("Build")
                .AddCoreTask(x => x.Build().FileVersion(BuildVersion.Version));
    }
    ```

- Get and Set build properties through attribute 

    Instead of setting build property through IBuildPropertiesContext  
    ```C#
     protected override void ConfigureBuildProperties(IBuildPropertiesContext context)
     {
            context.Properties.Set(BuildProps.BuildConfiguration, "Release");
     }
    ````
    it is possible to set it through attribute

    ```C#
        [BuildProperty(BuildProps.BuildConfiguration)]
        public string Configuration { get; set; } = "Release";
    ````

    Or

    ```C#
        [BuildConfiguration]
        public string Configuration { get; set; } = "Release";
    ````

- Pack FlubuCore script as global tool or execute it directly through console app.

    ```c#
        public class Program
        {
            public static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                var engine = new FlubuEngine();
                engine.RunScript<MyScript>(args);
            }
        }
    ```

- Introduces FlubuCore modules

   It is possible change FlubuCore internal logic by  replacing FlubuCore modules through DI. For example logging, target runner, task      context etc.. could be changed. 

   ```C#
   public class BuildScript : DefaultBuildScript
   {
     public override void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
     {
        services.Replace<IFlubuSession, MyFlubuSession>();
     }

     public override void Configure(ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
     {
         loggerFactory.AddProvider(new MyLoggerProvider());
     }
   }
   ```
   
   - Added DependeceOf to target
   
   ```C# 
    protected override void ConfigureTargets(ITaskContext context)
    {
           var b = context.CreateTarget("B")
                   .DependenceOf(A);
    }

## FlubuCore 2.14.0

- Add support for interactive task members. 

Example:

        protected override void ConfigureTargets(ITaskContext context)
        {
             context.CreateTarget("Example")
                    .AddTask(x => x.CompileSolutionTask()
                        .Interactive(m => m.BuildConfiguration("default value if interactive mode disabled or value is 
                         passed as argument."), consoleText: "Enter build configuration:"));

            context.CreateTarget("Example2")
                .SetAsDefault()
                .Do(Example2, 
                     "default value if interactive mode disabled or value is passed as argument", 
                      options => { options.Interactive(m => m.Param, "-test", consoleText: "Enter example value to print to console:"); });
        }

        private static void Example2(ITaskContext context, string value)
        {
            context.LogInfo($"Entered: {value}");
        }

If u run target Example2 from console u will be prompted by Flubu to enter value which will be then printed to console.

- Flubu now supports cleanup actions when hitting control + c.. If u want that cleanup actions are performed You have to explicitly set parameter in task Finally method or in group parameter.

Bellow is example in which FlubuCore performs specified cleanup actions when hitting control + c or control + break (two optional parameters with true value are added)

     context.CreateTarget("run.postgres")
            .SetAsDefault()
            .Group(
                target =>
                {
                    target
                        .AddTaskAsync(task =>
                            task
                                .DockerTasks()
                                .Run("postgres:10.5", string.Empty)
                                .Finally(innerContext => innerContext.LogInfo("Testing1"), true));
                }, innerContext => { innerContext.LogInfo("Testing2"); },
                cleanUpOnCancel: true);

## FlubuCore 2.8.2 

- FlubuCore is now available as .net core global tool. `dotnet tool install --global FlubuCore.GlobalTool`
- Flubu dotnet cli tool and web api is now available for .net core 2.1.
- Console arguments, configuration properties, enviroment variables can now be passed to script properties with FromArg attribute. Property doesn't need to have attribute. Argument key in that case is same as the property name.

      public class SimpleScript : DefaultBuildScript
      {
        [FromArg("-sn", "If true app is deployed on second node. Otherwise not.")]
        public bool deployOnSecondNode { get; set; }

        protected override void ConfigureBuildProperties(IBuildPropertiesContext context)
        {
        }

        protected override void ConfigureTargets(ITaskContext context)
        {
            context.CreateTarget("Deploy.Exapmle")
                .AddTask(x => x.FlubuWebApiTasks().GetTokenTask("user", "pass").SetWebApiBaseUrl("noade1Url"))
                .AddTask(x => x.FlubuWebApiTasks().UploadPackageTask("packageDir", "*.zip"))
                .AddTask(x => x.FlubuWebApiTasks().ExecuteScriptTask("Deploy", "DeployScript.cs"))
                .Group(target =>
                    {
                    target.AddTask(x => x.FlubuWebApiTasks().GetTokenTask("user", "pass").SetWebApiBaseUrl("noade2Url"))
                               .AddTask(x => x.FlubuWebApiTasks().UploadPackageTask("packageDir", "*.zip"))
                               .AddTask(x => x.FlubuWebApiTasks().ExecuteScriptTask("Deploy", "DeployScript.cs"));
                     },
                     when: c => deployOnSecondNode);
         }
       }

You could then pass argument to property like so:

`Dotnet flubu Deploy.Example -sn=true`

- Target's can now be defined with attribute on method.

        [Target("targetName", "a", "b")]
        [Target("targetName2", "c", "d")]
        [Target("targetName3", "e", "f")]
        public void Example(ITargetFluentInterface target, string source, string destination)
        {
                target.AddTask(x => x.CopyFileTask(source, destination, true));
        }

## Flubu 2.7.0
- Added Xunit task - For running xunit tasks with xunit console runner.
- WebApi: Option to include flubu web api server logs into ExecuteScript response.
- WebApi: Option to include StackTrace to error response.
- Added Build system providers - You can acces various build, commit... information for various build systems (such as Jenkins, TeamCity, AppVeyor, Travis...) 

      protected override void ConfigureTargets(ITaskContext context)
      {
            bool isLocalBuild = context.BuildSystems().IsLocalBuild;
            var gitCommitId = context.BuildSystems().Jenkins().GitCommitId;
      }

-  Added conditonal task execution with when cluase on single task (see bellow for group of tasks)

       context.CreateTarget("Example")
            .AddTask(x => x.CompileSolutionTask())
            .AddTask(x => x.PublishNuGetPackageTask("packageId", "pathToNuspec"))
                .When(c => c.BuildSystems().Jenkins().IsRunningOnJenkins);

- Added finally block on single task. Finally block acts just like finally in try catch  (see bellow for group of tasks)

       context.CreateTarget("Example")
            .AddTask(x => x.CompileSolutionTask())
            .AddTask(x => x.PublishNuGetPackageTask("packageId", "pathToNuspec")
                .Finally(c => c.Tasks().DeleteFilesTask("pathtoNuspec", "*.*", true).Execute(c)));

- Added onError block on single task.  You can perform some custom action when error occures on single task(see bellow for group of tasks)

       context.CreateTarget("Example")
            .AddTask(x => x.CompileSolutionTask())
            .AddTask(x => x.PublishNuGetPackageTask("packageId", "pathToNuspec")
                .OnError((c, ex) => c.Tasks().DeleteFilesTask("pathtoNuspec", "*.*", true).Execute(context)));

-  Added conditonal task execution with When clause on group of tasks.

       protected override void ConfigureTargets(ITaskContext context)
       {
             context.CreateTarget("Example")
            .AddCoreTask(x => x.Build())
            .Group(
                target =>
                {
                    target.AddCoreTask(x => x.Pack());
                    target.AddCoreTask(x => x.NugetPush("pathToPackage"));
                },
                when: c => !c.BuildSystems().Jenkins().IsRunningOnJenkins);
        }

- Finally on group of tasks: Added onFinally block on group of tasks. onFinally acts just like finally in try/catch.

        context.CreateTarget("Example")
                .AddCoreTask(x => x.Build())
                .Group(
                    target =>
                    {
                        target.AddCoreTask(x => x.Pack());
                        target.AddCoreTask(x => x.NugetPush("pathToPackage"));
                    },
                    onFinally: c =>
                    {
                        c.Tasks().DeleteFilesTask("pathToNupkg", "*.*", true).Execute(c);
                    });
- OnError on group of tasks:  You can perform some custom action when error occures in any of tasks that are in group.

        context.CreateTarget("Example")
            .AddCoreTask(x => x.Build())
            .Group(
                target =>
                {
                    target.AddCoreTask(x => x.Pack());
                    target.AddCoreTask(x => x.NugetPush("pathToPackage"));
                },
                onError: (c, error) =>
                {
                   //// some custom action when error occures in any of the task in group.
                });

## Flubu 2.6.0

            context.CreateTarget("deploy.PreProduction")
                .Do(Deploy, @"C:\Web", "AppPool_Preprod", "PreProduction");

            context.CreateTarget("deploy.Production")
                .Do(Deploy, @"d:\Web", "AppPool_Prod", "Production");
        }

        public void Deploy(ITargetFluentInterface target, string deployPath, string appPoolName, string enviromentName)
        {
            target.AddTask(x => x.IisTasks().ControlAppPoolTask(appPoolName, ControlApplicationPoolAction.Stop))
                .Do(UnzipPackage)
                .AddTask(x => x.DeleteDirectoryTask(deployPath, false).Retry(30, 5000))
                .AddTask(x => x.CreateDirectoryTask(deployPath, false))
                .AddTask(x => x.CopyDirectoryStructureTask(@"Packages\WebApi", deployPath, true))
